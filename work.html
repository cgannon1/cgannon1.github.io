  <h2>Articles</h2>
  <h4> Stories Beneath the Shell</h4>
  <p> Over the course of two semester, Spring 2019 and Fall 2019, I was a staff writer for an
  online campus publication, "Stories Beneath the Shell." Each week, I was responsible for
  pitching story ideas to editors and writing one weekly story. I wrote news, features and multimedia stories.
  After a year of writing, I was promoted to my current position, Assistant General Assignment Editor. Every week,
  I hold a general assignment meeting that is open to students of all majors, I create the general assignment news
  budget and I edit all of our general assignment articles. Below are links to my articles.</p>
